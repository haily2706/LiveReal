# Workflow Optimization Notes:

1. You will need to provide a PR comment template for the model to follow depending on your project's practices
2. You also might want to revise how the agent grabs the git context and generates comment messages

# Usage Tips:

- Depending on the project's context, you might want to integrate with some MCPs that provide status updates and notifications like Jira and Slack after the PR is created.
