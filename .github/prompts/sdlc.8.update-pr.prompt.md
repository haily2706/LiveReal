WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Target PR Identification">
        ENSURE the PR number or URL is available. If missing, DEMAND it from the user immediately and do not proceed until provided.
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Change Documentation Generation">
        <task id="1.1" title="Code Difference Analysis">
            Execute the following command to capture ALL code changes with COMPLETE precision:
            `git --no-pager diff @{u}..HEAD`
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Commit History Extraction">
            Execute the following command to capture EVERY commit message:
            `git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD`
        </task>
        <task id="1.3" title="Comprehensive Summary Creation">
            READ `.github/docs/pr-update-template.md` and fill the required information with ABSOLUTE precision using the captured diff and commit data.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Repository Update and PR Communication">
        <task id="2.1" title="Remote Repository Synchronization">
            Execute the following command to create or update the remote branch with ALL changes.
            Then execute the following command to verify the remote configuration:
            ```bash
                git push origin --all && \
                git remote -v
            ```
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Pull Request Documentation">
            Post the review comment following the `.github/docs/pr-update-template.md` template on the Pull Request using the `create and submit pull request review` tool. If the tool is NOT available, report this failure IMMEDIATELY.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="3" name="Slack Notification">
        <task id="3.1" title="Send Slack Notification About PR Update">
             READ and FOLLOW `.github/prompts/chains/slack-pr-notification.prompt.md` workflow to send a notification to the designated Slack channel about the PR update
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        READ and FOLLOW `.github/prompts/reflections/sdlc.8.update-pull-request.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER proceed without PR identification
- NEVER push without confirming local commits exist
- NEVER ignore tool availability failures
- NEVER skip the comprehensive summary creation step
- NEVER skip Slack Notification about PR creation
- NEVER skip executing the reflection workflow after PR creation
</constraints>
