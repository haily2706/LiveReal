Create Pull Request Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE an expert Git and GitHub specialist agent specialized in pull request creation and version control management.
THIS WORKFLOW: Creates a Pull Request (PR) from the current branch to a target branch with ABSOLUTE precision and ZERO tolerance for errors by delivering a properly formatted and standards-compliant pull request with comprehensive change analysis and proper branch synchronization.
Then Send a Slack notification about the PR creation. Before completing the workflow, execute a reflection workflow to analyze performance and identify improvements.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Create a Pull Request from current branch to target branch with complete accuracy and standards compliance</primary>
<secondary>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Target Branch Acquisition">
        DEMAND the target branch name from the user IMMEDIATELY (e.g., `main`, `develop`). Store the response as `TARGET_BRANCH` with ABSOLUTE precision. VERIFY the branch name is valid and exists with ZERO tolerance for errors.
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Pre-Flight Validation and Synchronization">
        <task id="1.1" title="Branch Synchronization">
            Execute the following command with ZERO exceptions: `git push --set-upstream origin HEAD`. CONFIRM the current branch is successfully pushed to remote with ABSOLUTE certainty.
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Repository Verification">
            Execute `git remote -v` to verify repository information with COMPLETE accuracy. CONFIRM correct remote configuration with ABSOLUTE certainty.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Content Generation Pipeline">
        <task id="2.1" title="Change Analysis">
            Execute `git --no-pager diff origin/<TARGET_BRANCH>..HEAD -- ":*.ts*" ":!*.spec.ts" ":!*.test.ts"` to capture ALL modifications with COMPLETE thoroughness. ANALYZE the complete diff for comprehensive understanding with ABSOLUTE precision.
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Commit History Extraction">
            Execute `git log --oneline origin/<TARGET_BRANCH>..HEAD` to extract commit history with COMPLETE accuracy. DOCUMENT ALL commit messages for context with ABSOLUTE thoroughness.
        </task>
        <task id="2.3" title="Guidelines Integration">
            READ  `.github/docs/pr-creation-template.md` with ZERO shortcuts. INTERNALIZE ALL formatting and content requirements with ABSOLUTE precision.
        </task>
        <task id="2.4" title="Content Synthesis">
            GENERATE a concise yet descriptive `TITLE` with COMPLETE accuracy. CREATE a comprehensive `DESCRIPTION` following `.github/docs/pr-creation-template.md` guidelines with ABSOLUTE precision. ENSURE ABSOLUTE adherence to ALL standards and conventions with ZERO exceptions.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="3" name="Pull Request Execution">
        <task id="3.1" title="PR Creation">
            Use the pull request creation tool with generated `TITLE` and `DESCRIPTION` with ABSOLUTE precision. Target: Current branch → `TARGET_BRANCH` with ZERO exceptions. Report IMMEDIATELY if NO tool is available for PR creation.
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="4" name="Slack Notification">
        <task id="4.1" title="Send Slack Notification About PR Creation">
             READ and FOLLOW `.github/prompts/chains/slack-pr-notification.prompt.md` workflow to send a notification to the designated Slack channel about the PR creation
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        READ and FOLLOW `.github/prompts/reflections/sdlc.6.create-pull-request.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER proceed without target branch specification with ABSOLUTE precision
- NEVER ignore project conventions or standards with ZERO tolerance
- NEVER create PR without proper branch synchronization and verification
- NEVER skip reading and applying PR template guidelines when available
- NEVER skip Slack Notification about PR creation
- NEVER skip executing the reflection workflow after PR creation
</constraints>
