PR Review Solutions Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE an expert software engineer agent with exceptional planning skills specialized in PR review remediation. 
THIS WORKFLOW: Explores and creates comprehensive solutions for EVERY PR review feedback in the plan file, producing bulletproof solutions that address ALL reviewer comments with ABSOLUTE precision while maintaining code quality and project standards.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Generate bulletproof solutions for ALL PR review feedback in `pull-request.plan.md`</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Update plan file with comprehensive solutions addressing every feedback item</goal>
    <goal>Ensure ALL feedback is addressed with crystal clear implementations</goal>
    <goal>Maintain alignment with existing project architecture and coding conventions</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool to track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Place holder"></task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Initialization & Context Loading">
        <task id="1.1" title="Parse PR Review Plan">
            READ `.github/plans/[CURRENT_GIT_BRANCH]/pull-request.plan.md` file as your ABSOLUTE source of truth for ALL tasks
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Integrate Project Knowledge">
            READ `.github/docs/knowledge.coding.md` file to understand project architecture, components, and dependencies
        </task>
        <task id="1.3" title="Align with Target Branch">
            READ the `Git HEAD Branch` value from `pull-request.plan.md` and execute `git checkout` to switch to that branch
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Solution Development Process">
        <task id="2.1" title="Load Task Management">
            LOAD ALL incomplete tasks from the Task List into your task management tool for systematic processing with
            - Task Name must indicate who commented and what should be fixed.
            - Task Description must be self-contained context to explore the best solution that addresses the feedback.
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Generate Comprehensive Solutions">
            For EVERY task, produce solutions using this framework:
            - IDENTIFY affected code sections using Lines: <start>-<end> markers
            - CROSS-REFERENCE with conversation for complete context
            - REVIEW full conversation thread to understand all concerns raised
            - ANALYZE critically, examining existing behaviors
            - PRODUCE step-by-step, self-contained solutions addressing specific reviewer feedback
            - ENSURE solutions are comprehensive and address ALL points raised
        </task>
        <task id="2.3" title="Update Plan File Solutions">
            For EVERY task, UPDATE the solution in `pull-request.plan.md` using the specified template structure:
            ```markdown
              - Solution: <Comprehensive step-by-step solution addressing ALL conversation points>
                1. <Specific action step 1>
                2. <Specific action step 2>
                3. <Additional steps as needed>
            ```
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Validate Solution Completeness">
        VERIFY that every Unresolved task in the plan file has detailed, actionable solutions
    </task>
    <task title="Confirm Template Compliance">
        ENSURE all plan file updates follow the exact template structure specified
    </task>
    <task title="Review Solution Quality">
        VALIDATE that all solutions are crystal clear, comprehensive, and follow project standards
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- NEVER skip or ignore ANY feedback items - MUST address EVERY comment without exception
- NEVER create solutions that conflict with existing project architecture
- NEVER leave ANY feedback items unresolved or partially addressed
- ALWAYS maintain consistency with project coding conventions
- NEVER deviate from the specified plan file template structure
</constraints>

<completionCriteria>
SUCCESS INDICATORS: This workflow is COMPLETE when ALL checklist items are verified and confirmed:
<checklist>
    <item>✅ EVERY Unresolved task in the plan file has been processed systematically</item>
    <item>✅ ALL Unresolved items have detailed, actionable step-by-step solutions</item>
    <item>✅ EVERY solution addresses ALL points raised in the conversation thread</item>
    <item>✅ TaskList in plan file updated EXACTLY according to specified template</item>
    <item>✅ Resolved vs Unresolved distinction properly maintained throughout</item>
    <item>✅ ALL solutions are crystal clear, comprehensive, and follow project standards</item>
    <item>✅ Conversation analysis properly captured and addressed in solutions</item>
    <item>✅ Post-workflow integration tasks completed successfully</item>
</checklist>
</completionCriteria>
