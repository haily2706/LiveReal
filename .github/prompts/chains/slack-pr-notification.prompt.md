WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1.  VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2.  EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3.  INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Place holder"></task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
<phase number="1" name="Notification">
    <task id="1.1" title="Identify Slack Message Content">
        READ `.github/docs/slack-notification-template.md` template to identify CHANNEL_ID and PAYLOAD that are required to send the Slack notification.
    </task>
    <task id="1.2" title="Send Slack Notification">
    Call the MCP tool `#conversations_add_message` with the following arguments to post a dynamic message to the specified Slack channel:
        <args>
        "channel_id": CHANNEL_ID,
        "content_type": "text/plain",
        "payload": PAYLOAD
        </args>
    </task>
</phase>
</phases>
