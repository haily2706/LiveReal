Generally follow bottom-up approach(Repository > Service > Controller):
1 Preparation: Setup shared infrastructure
2 Define core data models and DTOs
3 Functional implementation tasks
4 Non-functional requirements implementation tasks
5 Integration tasks
6 Input validation, error handling and logging (cross cutting concerns)
7 Deployment tasks
